						<p class="justify">Wolves are not only essential “biodiversity engineers” that preserve balance among animal and plant species, but also endlessly fascinating creatures who have much to teach humans.</p>

						<p class="justify">Founded in 1999 by Hélène Grimaud, the <strong>Wolf Conservation Center (WCC)</strong> is a non-profit organization that promotes wolf conservation by teaching people about wolves, their relationship to the environment, and our role in protecting their future.</p>

						<p class="justify">The WCC participates in the Species Survival Plan (SSP) and Recovery Plan for two critically endangered wolf species, the Mexican gray wolf (Canis lupus baileyi) and the red wolf (Canis rufus). The Mexican gray wolf and the red wolf are among the rarest mammals in North America, both species at one time were completely extinct in the wild. Presently there are approximately 400 Mexican gray wolves and 300 red wolves remaining in the world, the majority living within the network of facilities like the WCC.</p>

						<h2>About the mission of the center:</h2>

						<p class="justify">Through wolves, the WCC teaches a broader message of conservation, ecological balance, and personal responsibility for improved human stewardship of our World.</p>
		
						<p>This is accomplished by:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Promoting wolf conservation through education.</li>
							<li>Supporting wolf reintroduction in federally designated areas that can sustain viable wolf populations.</li>
							<li>Being the preeminent facility in the eastern United States for the captive breeding and pre-release of endangered wolf species.</li>
							<li>Providing the natural habitat for a few captive wolves where observation of natural behavior is possible.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>With the education programs, the Wolf Conservation Center works to convey the following messages:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Wolves in the wild are not dangerous to people.</li>
							<li>Wolves perform a vital role in the environment.</li>
							<li>It is everyone’s responsibility to do something each day to make the world a better place.</li>
						</ul>
